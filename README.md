Hello there, Fellow Innovators!

I'm a software architect and technical lead specializing in distributed systems and high-performance computing. I work primarily with Go, Python, C++, and Rust to design and build scalable, low-latency software on Kubernetes.

With a focus on cloud-native architecture and systems-level programming, I lead teams through the full development lifecycleâ€”emphasizing performance, reliability, and maintainability.

Based in Berlin and open to collaboration. Reach me at 'almasry' - 'at' - 'almasry.ws'.
